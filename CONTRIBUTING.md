# Contributing to ejabberd

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make ejabberd even better than it is
today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

* [Code of Conduct](#coc)
* [Signing the CLA](#cla)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep ejabberd community open-minded and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## <a name="requests"></a> Questions, Bugs, Features

### <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports
and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on dedicated
support platforms, the best being [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help
  someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general
support and redirect people to the section you are reading right now.

Other channels for support are:
- [ejabberd Mailing List][list]
- [ejabberd XMPP room][muc]: ejabberd@conference.process-one.net

## <a name="cla"></a> Signing the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Upon submmitting a Pull Request, we will ask you to sign our CLA if you haven't done
so before. It's a quick process, we promise, and you will be able to do it all online

You can read [ProcessOne Contribution License Agreement][cla] in PDF.
